Code refactoring:

 * If the ParClass approach checks out ok then generalize parMap etc.

Potential problems with current scheduling approach:
(Mostly addressed on the cilk-style branch)

 * Child vs. vs parent continuation stealing.

 * Non-random work stealing

 * Policy for idle workers, traffic on global IORef for every fork on
   every thread (scalability problem).

   -- One solution: let idle workers sleep rather than going on an
      idle list, possibly with an exponential backoff strategy.
